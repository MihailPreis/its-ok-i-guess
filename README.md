### Guess the game from which the Steam review came from!

Features reviews from the top 1000 most played games on Steam list on [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/graph/) as of July 19th.  
Reviews are scraped from the Steam Community reviews page for each app, sorted by funny and english language only.
